## What's inside?

This project uses Next.js for server-side rendering and React for building the user interface. The main component in this project is `Analyzer`, which renders a form with a textarea input and two buttons: one to analyze the text in the input, and another to download the results in JSON format. 

The `countWords` function takes a string of text as input and returns an object with key-value pairs where the keys are individual words in the text and the values are the frequency of each word. When the user submits the form, the `handleSubmit` function is called, which uses the `countWords` function to count the frequencies of the words in the input text and sets the results state using the `setResults` function.

If there are results, the component renders a grid of boxes displaying each word and its frequency. When the user clicks the download button, the `handleDownload` function creates a temporary anchor link with a `data:` URI containing the JSON-encoded results data, sets the `download` attribute to a filename based on the current date and time, triggers a click event on the anchor link, and then removes the anchor element from the DOM.
